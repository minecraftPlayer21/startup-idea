# 🎙️ VoxaLearn — AI Voice Agent for Interactive Learning

> *“Learning should feel like a conversation — not a wall of text.”*

---

## 🧠 What is VoxaLearn?

**VoxaLearn** is an AI-powered voice agent that helps students learn through real-time, conversational interaction. It listens, understands, and responds — just like a human tutor would. Built on cutting-edge AI and designed for students who benefit from auditory, responsive learning.

This is my **complete concept plan** for a voice-based AI assistant that supports personalized, accessible education. While I haven’t built the full product yet, I’ve outlined the entire stack, user flow, and roadmap, and I’m actively validating the concept.

## 🚀 Vision

Make education more natural, accessible, and empowering — especially for students who thrive through speech and interaction. VoxaLearn transforms studying into a two-way experience by letting you *talk* to your learning assistant and receive instant, intelligent guidance.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Engineering student with a deep interest in AI, voice interfaces, and education. I’ve worked on everything from LLM research and backend systems to real-time gesture tools — and now I’m exploring how to combine all of that to create something that helps students learn better, faster, and more naturally.
